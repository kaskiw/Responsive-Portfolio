<h3> Aspiring developer that enjoys playing video games, playing and wathching sports, hanging out with friends, and coding. I have always been fascinated by technology, and finding out how things work. Video games are what really drove my passion for technology at a very young age. I found it amazing how just pressing a button on a contorller caused the character to do certain actions. Also trying to break the game mechanics have also been something I have always been fascinated about. Though out my time in school I have been active in the sports scene, playing soccer, football, basketball, and lacrosse for my highschool. This is also the time where I started messing around on Myspace with basic coding as well as html in my web development class. After I graduated high school I went into the US Navy and was stations out of Norfolk, V.A and worked as an Aerographer's mate.
